# 🛒 Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing customer ordering habits on the Instacart grocery delivery platform using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The dataset contains information about customer orders, products, departments, and aisles. It was originally released for a Kaggle competition and has been slightly modified for educational use. The objective of this analysis is to uncover patterns in when customers place orders, what products are most frequently purchased, and how often items are reordered.

## 📌 Goals

- Clean and preprocess the raw datasets
- Merge and structure data for analysis
- Visualize order behavior by time and frequency
- Identify most ordered and reordered products
- Analyze customer reorder tendencies and cart behavior

## 📁 Datasets Used

- `instacart_orders.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `order_products.csv`
- `aisles.csv`
- `departments.csv`

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations

### ✅ Required Insights
- Distribution of orders by **hour of the day** and **day of the week**
- Time between repeated customer orders
- Most ordered products overall

### ✅ Deep Dive Insights
- Hourly ordering patterns on **Wednesdays vs. Saturdays**
- Number of orders per customer
- Top 20 reordered products

### ✅ Optional Analyses (Completed)
- Distribution of items per order
- Reorder ratios per product and per customer
- First item added to cart per order

## 📌 Notable Results

- Most orders are placed around **10 a.m.**, with **Sunday** being the most active shopping day.
- Reordering behavior is strong: ~60% of users reorder previously purchased products.
- **Bananas** and **Organic Strawberries** were among the most reordered and frequently added items.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Make sure all `.csv` files are placed in the same directory as the notebook
4. Run each cell in sequence to reproduce the analysis and plots
